.SS NAME
.PP
Simple Shell
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
This function requires the following elements:
.PP
Main file: \[lq]main_shell.c\[rq] Header file: \[lq]shell.h\[rq]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Shell is a command programming language that executes commands read from
a terminal or a file and breaks it up into words at whitespace (blanks
and tabs).
This shell mimics /bin/sh in it\[cq]s funcationaly.
It can be ran in both interacitve and noninteractive modes.
.SS BUILT\-INS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
env \- ./hsh prints the current environment to standard output.
exit \- when is entered, shell exits out of the shell program.
\f[R]
.fi
.SS INVOCATION
.PP
If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is
connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell.
.PP
If the standard input is used with a pipeline operator, |, to connect
the command, such as echo \[lq]qwerty\[rq] | ./hsh, then the shell is in
non\-interactive mode.
.PP
It is compiled in this way:
.PP
root\[at]d8922e3653ac:# gcc \-Wall \-Werror \-Wextra \-pedantic
\-std=gnu89 *.c \-o hsh root\[at]d8922e3653ac:# ./hsh
.PP
Run the following command to view the MAN page:
.PP
man \-l man_simple_shell.3
.SS EXAMPLES
.PP
root\[at]d8922e3653ac:# ./hsh
.PP
$ echo \[lq]qwerty\[rq] | /bin/sh \[lq]qwerty\[rq] | /bin/sh
.PP
$ echo \[lq]qwerty\[rq] | ./hsh \[lq]qwerty\[rq] | ./hsh
.SS RETURN VALUE
.PP
Upon successful return, the shell will always return a 0 for success.
If the shell program fails when a command is entered incorrectly or does
not exist in the $PATH, then shell program will exit out of the child
process and display an error message corresponding to the error the user
committed and return with a prompt.
.SS NOTES
.PP
All files and code used in .hsh were created and compiled on \[lq]Ubuntu
20.04.4 LTS\[rq] ## BUGS This is a simple shell (./hsh) there are many
features and builtin commands such as aliases, cd, and logical operators
that are not implemented.
